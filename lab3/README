Minimal Basic Interpreter

I used a class Program to store the whole Basic program.
The class mainly consist of a list of lines and a map of variables with all functions required.

My program can pass all tests and fixed several bugs as below:

Bugs fixed:
1. If user enter an empty line, the program will not report "Segmentation Fault".(Unlike demo)
2. If a variable use reserved words like "let", "print", then the program will report an error.(Unlike demo)
3. If user add extra text(for example, %^&*^&) after a legal line, then the interpreter will throw syntax error.(Unlike demo)
4. Support negative number in expressions.(Unlike demo)
5. Support variable starts with alpha and has digit in it.(Unlike demo)
